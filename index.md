# Keith Tan's Portfolio

Hello my name is Keith Tan, I am attending Cal State Fullerton and I am a third year. I plan to graduate in 2025. 

# Favorite Labs

* Lab 6 part 1

  We learned how to make a sandwich with this lab and in part 1 we learned how to correlate values such as numbers 0-3 to be the type of condiments we want to be put on our sandwich. After finding what we want on our sandwich our output would tell us our order and what we chose to be on our sandwich. 

* Lab 8 part 2

  We learned how to create averages of numbers in part 2 and for a person that likes to play games that include some sort of calculations this was interesting for me. We also learned how to utilize arguments which is something that we will be using in many bodies of code we will be making in the future. I also thought it was interesting that such a simple body of code is in calculators that we use. 

* Lab 7 part 1

  In this lab we learned how to create date differences between two different parts of time. This was useful such as trying to find what was the difference in time between present time and when I was born. Not only that but I see why many people are able to count the days precisely using a program like this.
